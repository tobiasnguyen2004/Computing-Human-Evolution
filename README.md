# Computing-Human-Evolution


Biologists use evolutionary trees to show species evolving from ancestor species. To practice using enumerations and recursion over lists and trees, we will write a program that automatically generates hypothesis trees.

Our program input will be real samples of DNA, the genetic code that describes how to build organisms. DNA has two complementary helices, each a sequence of the nucleotides adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. Adenine always appears opposite thymine; the same for guanine and cytosine.
